        <p>The Florida Panthers are a professional ice hockey team based in the Miami metropolitan area.
            They compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference,
            and initially played their home games at Miami Arena before moving to the FLA Live Arena in 1998. Located in Sunrise, Florida,
            the Panthers are the southernmost team in the NHL. The team's local broadcasting rights have been held by Bally Sports Florida (formerly
            SportsChannel and Fox Sports Florida) since 1996. The Panthers are primarily affiliated with two minor league teams: the Charlotte Checkers of the
            American Hockey League (AHL) and the Florida Everblades of the ECHL.</p>
        <p> The Panthers began playing in the 1993–94 NHL season, where they set the record for the most points by an expansion team in its inaugural season
            until surpassed by the Vegas Golden Knights in 2017–18. The team has made one appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1996, eventually losing the Finals
            to the Colorado Avalanche. Since then, the Panthers have only qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs seven times, not winning a playoff series again until 2022,
            and have struggled to find sustained success.</p>

        <h3>Early years (1992–2000)</h3>
        <p>Blockbuster Video magnate Wayne Huizenga was awarded an NHL franchise for Miami on December 10, 1992,[5] the same day The Walt Disney Company earned the rights
            to start a team in Anaheim that would become the Mighty Ducks. At the time, Huizenga owned both the newly founded Florida Marlins of Major League Baseball and a
            share of the National Football League (NFL)'s Miami Dolphins. The entry fee was $50 million. Huizenga announced the team would play at the Miami Arena, sharing the
            building with the National Basketball Association's Miami Heat, until a new arena was built.[6] Offices for the team were only established in June 1993, while vice
            president of business operations Dean Jordan conceded that "none of the business people, myself included, knew anything about hockey."[7] The new franchise would be the
            first professional ice hockey team in Miami since the folding of the Tropical Hockey League in 1939.[8]</p>
        <p>Wayne Huizenga was awarded a franchise from the NHL on December 10, 1992.
        <p>On April 20, 1993, a press conference in Ft. Lauderdale announced that the team would be named Florida Panthers, with former New York Islanders general manager Bill Torrey
            as president and Bobby Clarke as general manager. The team is named for the Florida panther, an endangered species of large cat endemic to the nearby Everglades region.[9]
            Once the logos and uniforms were unveiled on June 15, the team also announced its financial commitment to the panther preservation cause.[10] Huizenga had held the Panthers
            trademark since 1991, when he purchased it from a group of Tampa investors who sought to create an MLB team in the Tampa Bay area.[11]</p>
        <p>The new franchise joined the NHL for participation in the 1993–94 season, along with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The Panthers' and Ducks' rosters were filled in both the expansion
            draft and the 1993 NHL Entry Draft in June 1993, hosted by Quebec City;[12][13] that draft produced ten players who would eventually be a part of the 1996 Eastern Conference-winning team.[14]
        <p>The Panthers' first major stars were former New York Rangers goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck, rookie Rob Niedermayer and forward Scott Mellanby, who scored 30 goals in Florida's
            inaugural season.[15] Their first game was a 4–4 tie on the road against the Chicago Blackhawks, while their first win was a 2–0 shutout of the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Thunderdome
            before a then-NHL record crowd of 27,227. The Panthers had one of the most successful first seasons of any expansion team in league history, finishing just two points below .500 and
            narrowly missing out on the final 1994 playoff spot in the East.[16] Their first-year success was attributed mainly to the trap defense that first-year coach Roger Neilson implemented.
            This conservative style was widely criticized by NHL teams; some even suggested that the Panthers were ruining the game.[17] While the team executives expected the audience to consist of
            mostly "snowbird" Canadians living in Florida, the Floridians soon embraced the Panthers.[15] Helped by Miami's other teams having middling performances, the club averaged 94% capacity at
            the 14,500-seat Miami Arena, and sold 8,500 season tickets in 100 days.[15]</p>
        <p>In August 1994, general manager Clarke left to work for the Philadelphia Flyers; Bryan Murray was brought in from the Detroit Red Wings as his replacement.[18] After another close brush with
            the playoffs, finishing the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season again in ninth,[19] Neilson was fired following an argument with Murray regarding Ed Jovanovski, whom the Panthers chose as the
            number one overall pick at the 1994 NHL Entry Draft.[20] Doug MacLean, who had been the team's player development director, was promoted to coach.[21] The team then acquired Ray Sheppard from
            the San Jose Sharks at the NHL trade deadline and looked toward the playoffs for the first time.</p>

        <h3> Arrival of Bill Zito, return to dominance (2020–present) </h3>
        <p>Panthers management hired Bill Zito to succeed Tallon as the team's general manager on September 2, 2020.[39]
            During the shortened 2020–21 NHL season, the Panthers compiled 79 points in 56 games played, finishing the season in
            second place in the Atlantic Division, one point behind the Carolina Hurricanes. As such, they were pitted against division and
            statewide rival, the Tampa Bay Lightning, in the first round of the playoffs. They were defeated in 6 games to the eventual Stanley Cup champions,
            for yet another 1st round exit.</p>
        <p>Panthers and Capitals skaters warming up prior to a game during the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs. In the 2021–22 season, Quenneville led the Panthers
            to a 7–0–0 record through the team's first seven games, but he would resign from his coaching duties as a result of the fallout from the
            2010 Chicago Blackhawks sexual assault scandal on October 28, 2021.[40] The next day, the Panthers named former NHL player Andrew Brunette their interim head coach.
            [41] On April 3, 2022, the Panthers became the first team during the 2021–22 season to clinch a postseason berth, when they defeated the Buffalo Sabres at home, 5–3.
            This victory was also Florida's 48th of the season, breaking their previous record set during 2015–16 NHL season.[42] Three weeks later, on April 21, 2022, following
            a 5–2 victory over the Detroit Red Wings, the Panthers crowned themselves as Atlantic Division champions for the first time since the 2015–16 season.[43] The victory
            was also Florida's 12th consecutive, dating all the way back to a 7–4 win over the Montreal Canadiens on March 29.[44] This win streak matched another one achieved
            during the 2015–16 season, tying the franchise record. With the win, the Panthers improved to a stellar 56–15–6 record, tallying 118 points, and overcoming the Colorado
            Avalanche in the quest for the Presidents' Trophy. After an Avalanche defeat, and a Panthers 4–0 victory over the Ottawa Senators on April 28, the Panthers clinched the
            Presidents' Trophy for the first time in franchise history.[45] They would end the regular season with 122 points, with a 58–18–6 record, the best record registered in
            the league since division rivals Tampa Bay Lightning in 2018–19. On May 13, the Panthers advanced past the first round for the first time in 26 years, dating all the way
            back to the 1996 Eastern Conference Finals, by beating the Washington Capitals in six games, eliminating them with a 4–3 overtime victory.[46] However, their luck would
            run out in the Second Round, as the Panthers were swept in four games by the archrival the Tampa Bay Lightning. Florida went completely dry offensively, scoring only
            three goals throughout the whole four-game series.[citation needed]</p>


        <section id="logo-and-uniforms">
        <h2> Logo and Uniforms </h2>
        </section>

        <p>The Florida Panthers have had just two primary logos over the course of their history. Their first logo, used from 1993 to 2016, depicted a leaping panther.
            Other logos from the era included an alternate version of the "leaping panther" logo, this time holding a pair of broken hockey sticks, and a logo depicting a
            yellow sun behind a hockey stick and a palm tree. The "leaping panther" logo was redesigned and relegated to an alternate logo when the Panthers unveiled a new logo
            in the 2016–17 season. The current primary logo is a shield with the profile of a panther head below the word "Florida"; the same logo with the word "Panthers" above is
            also used interchangeably.[47]

        <p>The Panthers' first uniform set was used from 1993 to 2007. The red road and white home uniforms featured the leaping panther crest in front and the alternate palm tree
            logo on the shoulders. Diagonal stripes accentuated the sleeves and the yoke design was triangular in shape. Yellow and navy were used as accent colors.[47]
            In 1998, the Panthers debuted an alternate navy uniform, with the front crest depicting the leaping panther holding a pair of broken hockey sticks. Prior to the 2003–04 season,
            the navy uniform became the primary home uniform while the red uniform was relegated to alternate status. The crests on both uniforms were also switched.[47]
            Adopting the Reebok Edge template in 2007, the Panthers revealed new uniform designs. The navy and white uniforms sported a thicker stripe on each sleeve along with added piping.[47]
            In 2009, the Panthers unveiled a navy alternate uniform, featuring a roundel crest depicting a panther head surrounded by the team name. Powder blue replaced red as trim color and the
            alternate "FLA" sunshine logo was placed on the shoulders. This uniform was used for three seasons.[47]
            Before the 2011–12 season, the Panthers retired their primary navy uniforms and returned to wearing red uniforms at home. The piping on the chest was also eliminated.[47]
            The Panthers overhauled their visual design prior to the 2016–17 season, replacing yellow with flat gold as trim color. Red uniforms featured the shield logo with the team name,
            while the white uniforms used the variation with the city name. An alternate logo featuring the flag of Florida below a crawling panther is added on the sleeves. Both sets feature
            thick contrasting stripes on the chest and sleeves. The basic design was retained once Adidas took over as supplier prior to the 2017–18 season.[47]
            For the 2020–21 season, the Panthers released a "Reverse Retro" alternate uniform, essentially a recoloring of the team's original uniform. In this case, the Panthers wore their
            original 1990s "leaping panther" uniform, but with a navy base and flat gold replacing yellow as a trim color.[48] A second "Reverse Retro" uniform was unveiled, again using the same
            1990s-era template but with a powder blue base (a nod to the 2009–12 navy alternates) and the alternate palm tree, sun and stick logo in front.[49]</p>
